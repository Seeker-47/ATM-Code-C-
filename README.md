# ATM-Code-C++
This is a mini ATM Project...
What to do was as follows:


     "Create a C++ program for an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) that can perform the following
     functions:
    1. Display a welcome message, "Welcome to Student Bank" and prompt the user to enter
    their PIN (Personal Identification Number).
    2. Validate the PIN. The program should have a pre-defined valid PIN (e.g., 1234) and allow
    the user three attempts to enter the correct PIN. If the user enters an incorrect PIN
    three times, the program should terminate.
    3. Once the user is validated, the program should display a menu of options:
     Check Balance: Display the current balance of the user's account.
     Withdraw: Prompt the user to enter the amount they want to withdraw, and then
    deduct that amount from their account balance. The program should also ensure that
    the user has sufficient funds to withdraw the requested amount.
     Deposit: Prompt the user to enter the amount they want to deposit, and then add that
    amount to their account balance.
     Quit: Exit the program.
    4. After each transaction (i.e., balance check, withdrawal, or deposit), the program should
    display the updated balance.
    5. The program should be able to handle multiple users, each with its own balance and
    PIN.
    6. Use proper error handling and validation techniques throughout the program to ensure
    that the user inputs are valid and the program do not crash or behave unexpectedly.
    7. Use functions to modularize the code and improve readability and maintainability."
    
I used functions,if else and switch statements in it.
also a library 'limit' is used.
